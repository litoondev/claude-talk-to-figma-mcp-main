## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **🏷️ Direct Variable Renaming (`rename_variable` & `rename_variables`)**:
  - Implemented `rename_variable` to rename variables directly in the document via the official Figma Plugin API (`variable.name = newName`), with support for lookup by `variableId` or `name` (with case-insensitive fallback) and optional collection filtering.
  - Implemented `rename_variables` for bulk variable renaming, supporting both explicit arrays of renames and pattern-based find & replace (e.g. `find: "Pages/", replace: "Layout/Section/"`).
  - Enhanced `set_variable` to support `newName`, enabling seamless variable renaming even when `value` is omitted, eliminating the `Missing value parameter` error on rename attempts.
- **⚡ Execute Code Tool (`execute_code`)**:
  - Direct Plugin API JavaScript execution sandbox (`execute_code`), allowing Claude and agents to run arbitrary asynchronous JavaScript scripts directly in Figma with `figma` and `params` in scope, with cyclic-safe object serialization.
- **🔗 File Key Persistence & Fallback (`set_file_key`, `get_file_key`, and UI input)**:
  - Added `set_file_key` command/tool to configure or override the Figma file key or file URL. Full Figma URLs (e.g. `https://www.figma.com/design/:fileKey/...`) are parsed automatically.
  - Stored in `figma.clientStorage` and in-memory cache, so `getFileKey()` falls back to this key whenever native `figma.fileKey` is unavailable or null.
  - Added an interactive "File URL or Key" input field directly inside the Figma plugin UI (`ui.html`).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **🔑 Automatic file-key resolution — no more pasting file URLs**: `fileKey` is now optional on every comment tool. When omitted, the server asks the connected Figma plugin which file is open and uses that. `get_my_comments` with no arguments at all defaults to the open file.
  - New plugin command `get_file_key` (`src/claude_mcp_plugin/code.js`) returning `figma.fileKey`, the file name and the current page.
  - New `get_current_file` tool to inspect that resolution directly.
  - `reply_to_comments` resolves the open file **once per batch**, not per entry.
  - Passing `fileKey` explicitly still bypasses the plugin entirely, so the tools remain usable with no channel connected.
  - `figma.fileKey` requires the private plugin API. It is populated for locally imported and organisation plugins (this project sets `enablePrivatePluginApi: true`) but is `undefined` on public plugin builds; that case produces an explicit message instead of a silent failure.

### Fixed
- **🧩 Unsubstituted DXT placeholders**: if a host fails to expand `${user_config.figma_access_token}`, the literal template used to reach Figma and return a misleading `403 Invalid token`. `getFigmaToken()` now detects the placeholder and explains how to configure the token directly in `claude_desktop_config.json`.

### Changed
- **⚠️ `get_my_comments` no longer errors on an empty scope.** It previously required one of `teamId` / `projectIds` / `fileKeys`; it now falls back to the currently open file.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **📦 Token prompt in the DXT package**: `manifest.json` now declares a `user_config` block, so Claude Desktop prompts for the Figma personal access token on install (stored as `sensitive`, never written into a config file by hand) and injects it as `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Comment sweep concurrency is exposed the same way. Both are optional — leaving them blank keeps every non-comment tool working exactly as before.
- **💬 Comment tools (Figma REST API)**: Read and reply to Figma comments across a whole team, selected projects, or an explicit file list. Figma's Plugin API has no comment access, so this introduces a second, independent transport alongside the WebSocket relay: a REST client authenticated with a personal access token (`FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`). These tools work without the socket running and without `join_channel`; all existing tools are unaffected and need no token.
  - `get_figma_account` – validate the token and resolve the caller's user id.
  - `list_figma_files` – expand a `teamId` / `projectIds` into file keys.
  - `get_file_comments` – threaded comments for a single file, with author, anchor, resolved status and timestamps.
  - `get_my_comments` – the full sweep: resolve scope → fetch per file with bounded concurrency → thread → filter to the token owner. Supports `authorScope` (`root` vs `any`), `includeResolved`, `onlyAwaitingReply`, `since`, `maxFiles` and `format` (`text` | `json`).
  - `reply_to_comment` – post a reply into an existing thread (inherits the thread's pin).
  - `reply_to_comments` – batch replies with per-item success/failure reporting and a `dryRun` preview.
  - `delete_comment` – delete your own comment or reply.
- **🌐 Figma REST client** (`utils/figma-rest.ts`): `X-Figma-Token` auth read lazily from the environment, retry with exponential backoff honouring `Retry-After` on `429`/`408`/`5xx`/network errors, no retries on `401`/`403`/`404`, per-request timeouts, and a `mapWithConcurrency` helper that keeps team-wide sweeps under Figma's rate limits.
- **🧵 Comment threading helpers** (`utils/comment-helpers.ts`): pure, network-free logic for grouping Figma's flat comment list into threads, describing pin anchors, filtering, and rendering digests — orphaned replies (deleted root) are promoted rather than dropped.
- **⚙️ REST configuration**: `FIGMA_API_BASE_URL`, `FIGMA_API_CONCURRENCY`, `FIGMA_API_MAX_RETRIES` and `FIGMA_API_TIMEOUT_MS` environment overrides.
- **🧪 Tests**: 48 new tests — unit coverage for the REST client and threading logic, plus an integration suite that drives the real tool handlers against a stub Figma API (including partial-failure and dry-run paths).

### Fixed
- **🏗️ Declaration build**: `src/socket.ts` passed a bare `Server` type to `Bun.serve`'s `fetch` handler, but `Server` is generic in current `bun-types`. This failed the `tsup --dts` step with `TS2314`, breaking `npm run build` and `npm run build:dxt` (the JS bundles emitted fine, so the failure only surfaced at declaration generation). Now parameterised as `Server<any>`, matching the `ServerWebSocket<any>` usage elsewhere in the file.

### Notes
- Comment tools are deliberately absent from the `FigmaCommand` union in `types/index.ts`, since they never travel over the WebSocket relay.
- Files a token cannot open are reported at the end of a sweep rather than aborting it — expected when sweeping an entire team.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **🤖 Multi-Agent / Parallel Execution**: Added a server-side FIFO command queue to the WebSocket relay. This allows multiple AI agents (e.g. Claude Code sub-agents or Cursor parallel processes) to work on the same Figma file simultaneously without blocking the single-threaded Figma plugin or causing timeouts. Achieves up to ~1.87x speedup for complex generation tasks. (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #77](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/77))
- **🛡️ Node Info Depth Control**: Added `depth` parameter to `get_node_info` and `get_nodes_info` (default 1) to prevent token overflow in giant documents. Children beyond the depth limit return as minimal stubs with a `_childrenTruncated: true` flag, allowing for progressive disclosure. (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #90](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/90))
- **✨ Plugin Quality Improvements**: Enhanced stability and usability across core tools. (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #87](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/87))
  - Robust layout grids (properly handling STRETCH vs fixed-pixel modes).
  - Enhanced `clone_node` with `parentId` support for direct container injection.
  - Smart text wrapping and numeric font weight mapping (mapping 100-900 to Figma styles).
  - Unified styling (fill/stroke) for all basic shape creation tools.
  - Automatic column grids for top-level frames for better alignment.
  - Safe color utilities to prevent accidental black-fills on malformed input data.
- **🎯 Unicast Response Routing**: Responses from Figma are now exclusively routed to the exact agent that requested them via session tracking, eliminating broadcast noise across multiple connected clients.
- **🧱 Component Detaching**: Added `detach_instance` tool to convert component instances back into regular frames. (Thanks to [hoxinzhen](https://github.com/hoxinzhen) - [PR #85](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/85))
- **🎨 Local Style Creation**: New tools to create and manage reusable styles in Figma's local library. (Thanks to [Kejsaren](https://github.com/hello-amed) - [PR #83](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/83))
  - `create_text_style` – Create typography styles (font, size, spacing, etc).
  - `create_paint_style` – Create reusable SOLID color styles.
  - `create_effect_style` – Create reusable shadow and blur styles.
- **✨ Prototype Interaction Tools**: Added two new tools for managing Figma prototype logic. (Thanks to [ravszmig](https://github.com/ravszmig) - [PR #82](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/82))
  - `set_reactions` – Programmatically configure triggers (CLICK, HOVER, etc.), actions (NAVIGATE, OVERLAY, BACK), and transitions. Includes smart logic to handle overlay position and background behavior.
  - `get_reactions` – Inspect and debug existing interactions on any node.
- **🛡️ Robust Type Coercion**: Implementation of Zod-based coercion helpers (`coerce.number()`, `coerceBoolean`, `coerceJson`) to guarantee that all tools correctly handle parameters sent as strings (common in MCP/WebSocket environments). (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #79](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/79))
- **🛠️ Integration & DX Fixes**:
  - **Fixed `get_pages`**: Added automatic `figma.loadAllPagesAsync()` to prevent "unloaded page" runtime errors.
  - **`parentId` in Components**: Added `parentId` support to `create_component_from_node` for deterministic container injection via the relay server.
  - **Plugin Compatibility**: Fixed syntax errors in `code.js` to ensure support for diverse Figma plugin execution environments.


### Changed
- **⚠️ Breaking Changes for State Independence**: To guarantee race-condition-free parallel execution, implicit page caching has been completely ripped out:
  - `set_current_page` is now completely **blocked** and deprecated by the server.
  - State-altering creation tools (e.g. `create_frame`, `create_rectangle`, `create_text`) now strictly require the `parentId` argument explicitly to declare where elements should be instantiated.
  - Updated tool descriptions to explicitly guide LLMs towards using the `parentId`.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **🔧 Zod compatibility**: Updated `zod` dependency from `^3.24.0` to `^3.25.0` to align with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@latest` (v1.27.1+) which requires `zod: "^3.25 || ^4.0"`. This resolves the `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_zod')` error that caused `tools/list` to fail and prevented all 54 tools from loading in Claude Desktop and Cursor ([#80](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/issues/80), [#81](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/issues/81)).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **🗒️ FigJam Support**: Six new tools for reading and writing FigJam boards (Thanks to [Rob Dearborn](https://github.com/rfdearborn))
  - `get_figjam_elements` – read all stickies, connectors, shapes-with-text, sections, and stamps on the current page
  - `create_sticky` – create a sticky note with text and colour (yellow, pink, green, blue, purple, red, orange, teal, gray, white)
  - `set_sticky_text` – update the text on an existing sticky note
  - `create_shape_with_text` – create a labelled FigJam shape (SQUARE, ELLIPSE, ROUNDED_RECTANGLE, DIAMOND, TRIANGLE_UP, TRIANGLE_DOWN, PARALLELOGRAM_RIGHT, PARALLELOGRAM_LEFT)
  - `create_connector` – draw an arrow or line between two nodes (by ID) or between canvas positions, with configurable line style and arrowheads
  - `create_section` – create a labelled colour region for grouping board content
- **🖼️ Image Manipulation Tools**: Complete image handling support for Figma nodes (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #61](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/61))
  - `set_image_fill`: Apply images from URL or base64 data with scaleMode options (FILL, FIT, CROP, TILE).
  - `get_image_from_node`: Extract image metadata (hash, scaleMode, rotation, filters).
  - `replace_image_fill`: Replace existing images while preserving transforms and filters.
  - `apply_image_transform`: Adjust image position, scale, rotation (90° increments), and scaleMode.
  - `set_image_filters`: Apply 7 types of color/light adjustments (exposure, contrast, saturation, temperature, tint, highlights, shadows).
- **📐 Coordinate Consistency**: Added `localPosition` support to `get_node_info` and `get_nodes_info` (batch) for full parity with local coordinate transforms (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #57](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/57)).
- **📝 Fixed-Width Text**: Added `width` parameter to `create_text` tool for better layout control and wrapping (Thanks to [leeyc09](https://github.com/leeyc09) - [PR #59](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/59)).

### Fixed
- **🔄 Image Features**: 
  - Image rotation properly implemented (90-degree increments) inside node fills (#61).
  - Image filters are now preserved when replacing images using `replace_image_fill` (#61).
- **🎯 Coordinate System**: Fixed mismatch between `get_node_info` and `move_node` by clarifying and unifying local vs global coordinate usage across all tools (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #57](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/57)).
- **⚡ Performance & Stability**:
  - Optimized `get_nodes_info` using a high-performance native batch implementation in the plugin.
  - Fixed plugin race condition by awaiting `setCharacters` in text node creation (#59).
  - Pinned `zod` dependency to `^3.24.0` to resolve installation failures in containerized/fresh environments (#59).
- **🐳 Docker**: Fixed Dockerfile to run as a network bridge (WebSocket server) and added comprehensive setup documentation (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #56](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/56)).

### Notes
- **Image Handling**: `apply_image_transform` rotates the image fill inside the node boundary; to rotate the entire node, use `rotate_node`. External URLs are subject to the `allowedDomains` list in `manifest.json`.
- **API Parity**: Standardized `x`/`y` descriptions across all creation and modification tools to explicitly reference local coordinates.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **🛠️ 20 New Tools**: Massive expansion of Figma capabilities including:
  - **Transformation**: `rotate_node`, `reorder_node`, `convert_to_frame`.
  - **Properties**: `set_node_properties` (visibility, lock, opacity).
  - **Visuals**: `set_gradient`, `boolean_operation`, `set_svg`, `get_svg`, `set_image`.
  - **Layout & Guides**: `set_grid`, `get_grid`, `set_guide`, `get_guide`.
  - **Documentation**: `set_annotation`, `get_annotation`.
  - **Variables**: `get_variables`, `set_variable`, `apply_variable_to_node`, `switch_variable_mode`.

  (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #76](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/76))
- **🌓 Dark Mode**: Added a dark and light mode toggle to the plugin UI for better integration with Figma's themes.
- **📋 Enhanced Clipboard**: The plugin now copies the full connection instruction instead of just the channel name, making it easier to paste into Claude.

### Fixed
- **⚡ Error propagation**: Error responses from Figma now resolve immediately instead of waiting for the 60s timeout. The WebSocket message handler in `websocket.ts` now robustly checks for errors at both the root level (`myResponse.error`) and nested inside the result (`myResponse.result.error`).
- **🎨 UI Refinement**: Adjusted plugin dimensions and mode selector opacity for a cleaner look. Structured the UI script into a class for better maintainability.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **🔄 Component Variants**: New `set_instance_variant` tool to change variant properties without recreating the instance. Preserves instance overrides like text and colors. (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #50](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/50))
- **📁 Custom Installation Path**: The launcher now supports an optional second argument to specify a custom installation directory (e.g., `npx claude-talk-to-figma-mcp ./my-folder`).
- **🇰🇷 Korean Localization**: Added UX/UI specialist prompt in Korean (`prompts/prompt-ux-ui-specialist-ko.md`). (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #54](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/54))

### Fixed
- **📡 Channel Reliability**: Added verification via ping when joining a channel to prevent false success messages and ensure the Figma plugin is active. (Thanks to [ehs208](https://github.com/ehs208) - [PR #52](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/52))
- **🔗 Channel Verification**: Fixed `join_channel` accepting invalid channel codes. Now verifies connection by sending a ping after join, providing fast feedback (12s timeout) instead of waiting for first command to timeout (60s). Added internal `ping` command for connection verification.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **🎨 Selection Colors**: New `set_selection_colors` tool to recursively change colors of all vector nodes within the current selection. Ideal for coloring icon sets. (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #49](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/49))
- **📝 Enhanced Text Alignment**: Added full support for horizontal and vertical text alignment (Top/Middle/Bottom and Left/Center/Right/Justified). (Thanks to [mmabas77](https://github.com/mmabas77) - [PR #49](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/49))

- **🛡️ Type Safety**: Added missing `set_selection_colors` to `FigmaCommand` union type to resolve TypeScript compilation errors.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **🚀 Unified Launcher**: New `npx claude-talk-to-figma-mcp` command that handles repository setup, dependencies, and execution in a single step.
- **🛠️ Smart Bootstrapping**: Automated Bun detection and installation prompts for an optimized experience.

### Fixed
- **🛡️ Type Safety**: Updated `FigmaCommand` union types to include all new tools, resolving TypeScript compilation errors during CI/CD.

- **🏷️ Rename Node**: New `rename_node` tool for better document organization (Thanks to [Beomsu Koh](https://github.com/GoBeromsu) - [PR #36](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/36))
- **📑 Page Management**: Comprehensive suite of tools for managing document pages: `create_page`, `delete_page`, `rename_page`, `get_pages`, and `set_current_page` (Thanks to [sk (kovalevsky)](https://github.com/kovalevsky) - [PR #32](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/32))

### Fixed
- **🚀 Performance**: Optimized component lookup using `findAllWithCriteria` to resolve initialization timeouts (Thanks to [Rob Dearborn](https://github.com/rfdearborn) - [PR #42](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/42))
- **📸 SVG Export**: Corrected format parameter handling for SVG exports and increased timeouts for large exports (Thanks to [sk (kovalevsky)](https://github.com/kovalevsky) - [PR #32](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/32))
- **🛡️ Validation**: Improved Zod validation for `join_channel` by making the channel parameter strictly mandatory (Thanks to [Timur](https://github.com/Mirsmog) - [PR #29](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/29))

## [0.6.1] - 2025-08-02

### Fixed
- **`set_stroke_color` Tool**: Corrected a validation rule that incorrectly rejected a `strokeWeight` of `0`. This change allows for the creation of invisible strokes, aligning the tool's behavior with Figma's capabilities. (Thanks to [Taylor Smits](https://github.com/smitstay) - [PR #16](https://github.com/arinspunk/claude-talk-to-figma-mcp/pull/16))
